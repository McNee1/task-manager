## Slice Overview

**Slice Name:** Space

**Purpose and Responsibilities:**

- Manages workspace functionality and organization
- Provides workspace display and management components
- Handles workspace lifecycle and state management
- Integrates with Project, Group, and User entities for comprehensive workspace management

**User Needs Addressed:**

- Creating and managing individual workspaces
- Organizing projects and groups within workspace contexts
- Managing workspace permissions and user access
- Supporting multi-workspace organization and collaboration

**Role in Architecture:**
Core business domain entity that provides workspace organization capabilities, enabling multi-tenant project management and collaborative workflows.

## Main Component

**Name:** Space

**Purpose:** Displays workspace information with project statistics and interactive elements for workspace management.

**What it renders:**

- Workspace name, description, and metadata
- Project counts and completion percentages
- Interactive elements for workspace selection
- Visual indicators for workspace status

**Key Props:**

- Space data containing name, description, and project relationships
- Click handler for workspace selection and navigation
- Optional children content for additional elements
- CSS classes for styling customization

**Interaction with slice:**
Uses internal state for computing workspace statistics, completion percentages, and managing workspace-specific interactions and display logic.

**Important behaviors:**

- Workspace statistics calculation and display
- Interactive workspace selection and navigation
- Visual state management based on workspace properties
- Responsive design adaptation

## Usage Example

**Basic Space usage:**
The Space component displays workspace information with project statistics and interactive elements. It accepts workspace data and renders workspace details with completion indicators.

**Using space types:**
Space types define data structures with properties like id, name, description, and relationships to projects, groups, and users.

**API operations:**
The space API provides functions for fetching workspaces by ID, creating new workspaces, updating existing workspaces, and deleting workspaces. These operations handle workspace lifecycle management.
