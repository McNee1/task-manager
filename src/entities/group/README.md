## Usage Example

**Basic Group usage:**
The Group component displays group information with project statistics and interactive elements. It accepts group data and renders group details with completion indicators.

**Using group types:**
Group types define data structures with properties like id, name, description, and relationships to projects and spaces.

**API operations:**
The group API provides functions for fetching groups by ID, creating new groups, updating existing groups, and deleting groups. These operations handle group lifecycle management.
